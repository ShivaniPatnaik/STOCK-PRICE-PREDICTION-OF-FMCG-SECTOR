This project is about the prediction of a stock using Machine Learning. This analysis is used by the most of the stockbrokers while making the stock predictions. The programming language is used to predict the stock market using machine learning is Python.  In this we propose a Machine Learning (ML) approach that will be trained from the available stocks data and gain intelligence and then uses the acquired knowledge for an accurate prediction. This study uses a machine learning technique called Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest Classifier and Linear Regression methods to predict stock prices for the large and small capitalizations. The study aims to analyse the analysis of NSE listed FMCG companies in India with a sample size of four companies for a period from 2000 to 2018. From the Economic analysis, it is found that Gross Domestic Product, Inflation, Interest rates, Exchange rate and Consumer Confidence has impact on FMCG sector.
